# odin-recipes
the odin-recipes project aims to test and solidify the basics of html and git commands that have been covered 
by the end of the project, I expect to have solidified html basics and have understanding of how the language works.
this includes the use of html tags appropriately together with their attributes.
further more, I am to make it my second nature to use git commands on the command line.
