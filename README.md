# odin-recipes
The Odin Recipes project is designed to test and strengthen my understanding of both HTML and Git commands. By the end of this project, I aim to achieve the following goals:

Solidify my grasp of basic HTML concepts, ensuring I can use HTML tags appropriately along with their attributes.
Develop a deeper understanding of how HTML as a language works.
Become proficient in using Git commands directly from the command line, making them second nature in my workflow.
This project will serve as a practical way to apply and reinforce these foundational skills.
